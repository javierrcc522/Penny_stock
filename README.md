# _Penny Stock 12.25.2017_
#### By _**Javier Jimenez**_

## Description and Project Goals
_This project is my capstone for school. The goal here is to look up any stock and it immediately get information ( about the stock/ penny stock ) that other wise would take a while to gather. In the Penny stock day trading world, it's crucial to know as much information as possible from the stock to potentially make money and putting the odds on my favor. I will be adding accounts so user can log in and save stocks to their watch list and keep track of them. I will also write an algorithm that will tell you if it's a good idea to invest in the stock base of the information given._
